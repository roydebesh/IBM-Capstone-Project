    "In this project we will try to find a suitable locations for staying, who is planning to relocate to Madrid for some time, based on his/her personal preferences of the surrounding neighbourhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the data science mechanism to generate more information about the nearby venues and whereabouts, which will help stakeholders or interested people to take the decision and plan accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3 – Data**\n",
    "We will mainly use the wiki sites to extrace the data for these informations for Madrid:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "We might use few more additional sites as required, listed below but not limited to:<br>\n",
    "https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/m/Madrid.htm\n",
